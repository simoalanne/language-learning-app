  const prompt = `You are tasked with generating vocabulary translation tasks for a language learner.
  The goal is to provide learners with useful and topic-relevant vocabulary that helps expand their active vocabulary.
  Generate a JSON array containing ${wordCount || 10} unique items. Each item should be a ${wordTypes?.join(" or ") || "word or a very short expression"}.
  All items must:
  - Be related to the topic: "${topic || "general"}"
  - Be appropriate for a learner at skill level: "${skillLevel || "average"}"
  
  Each item must have this structure:
  {
    "id": <number>,
    "translations": [
      { "languageName": "English", "word": "..." },
      { "languageName": "Finnish", "word": "..." },
      ...
    ]
  }
  
  Requirements:
  - Translations must be included for all of the following languages: ${includedLanguages?.join(", ")}
  - All translations should be grammatically correct and follow the languages grammar rules meaning words should never be capitalized unless it is a language convention (e.g. "I" in English).
  - Avoid words that are the same in one or more of the translation languages. For example words like "pizza" or "taxi" is a word that is the same in most of the spoken languages.
  - All entries must be unique
  - Do not include any explanations or extra text â€” only return a JSON array in the format shown above
